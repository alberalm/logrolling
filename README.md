Logrolling: The art of making life easier

![Java CI with Maven (Server)](https://github.com/palmenros/logrolling/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven%20(Server)/badge.svg)

This repository contains project documentation, the Android Client and Java Server. There is a CI action building the Java Server on every commit affecting it. To get the latest server `.jar` file without compiling with maven, download the `.jar` from `CI Server Build` [release](https://github.com/palmenros/logrolling/releases/tag/CI).
